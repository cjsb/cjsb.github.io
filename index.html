						<p STYLE="text-align:justify">This graduation work, made under the supervision of Prof. Veronica Teichrieb, aims to investigate the applicability of the SPH to fluid simulation and ways of reconstruct the fluid surface based on a ray tracer algorithm.
						Using CUDA technology, a parallel implementation of the Weakly Compressible SPH was made and to reconstruct the fluid surface a ray tracing system named Real Time Ray Tracer was used together with a blur method named Screen Space Curvature Flow.</p>

						<p STYLE="text-align:justify">This summer project was done under the supervision of Dr. Mark Jones and Dr. Chenfeng Li and had the goal of implementing a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) for liquid simulations based in the paper <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~rbridson/docs/schechter-siggraph2012-ghostsph.pdf">Ghost SPH for Animating Water</a> by Schechter and Bridson. 
						The algorithm creates new layer of particles around the surface using a Poisson Disk scheme to solve the free surface problem. To test the algorithm, a 2D Dam Break problem was used and Metaballs rendering method using POV-Ray to show the results.

						<p STYLE="text-align:justify">We propose a pipeline using computer vision techniques for augmenting existing surfaces through touch and sound. Computer vision is adopted in the content preparation phase, speeding up the assistive content elaboration. Conductive material is deposited over the image and sound feedback is given by mapping printed elements to specific sounds. We show that infant books can be easily transformed into assistive content for visually impaired children using the proposed technology.</p>

						<p STYLE="text-align:justify">Fluid simulation using meshless methods has increasingly become a robust way to solve mechanics problems that require dealing with large deformations, in that way, it is briefly shown what the main challenges and advances in the area are. The smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is then introduced. One of its variations is the Weakly Compressible SPH (WCSPH), which was used as a baseline to implement the method used in this work, called XSPH. Finally, four usual test cases of fluid simulation are analyzed: the lid-driven cavity flow, the dam break, the Poiseuille flow and the elliptic drop. The analysis concluded that the method used in this work performs at least as well as the most reliable and accurate models, and in some aspects performs better.</p>

						<div class="pubAbstract">
						<p STYLE="text-align:justify">Personality testing has become quite popular in job selection in an attempt to predict human behavior and deduce if the person tested has the quali- fication for the job. In Brazil, a commonly used test was introduced by Agostinho Minicucci and it is able to predict personality by the ability of writing vertical traces distributed in lines over time. The measurement of the test results is done manually by a psychologist, which demands a lot of time and work effort. To overcome those problems, a solution is proposed using image processing to measure the results of the test automatically. The solution was validated with 3 psychologists, being able to calculate the productivity of the tested person, the size of each line stroke, the angle of a line stroke, the distance between 2 consecutive strokes, the distance between two lines of strokes, the distance between lines and borders, the direction of a line of strokes and the regularity of the writing. The solution was able to measure with precision most of the variables, except the trace irregularity which had a 76% compatibility with psychologists manual classifications. This was expected due to the fact it is a qualitative analysis that can vary between different psychologists as well.</p>

						<p STYLE="text-align:justify">This paper analyzes basic operations commonly used in textual data recovery algorithms in order to benefit from parallel CUDA architecture of NVIDIA. Four different operations were implemented and compared with their implementations in CPU: exact and approximate search strings, characters substitution and frequency calculation. Several tests were carried out varying the size of the database, the size of the requested word and the number of occurrences of the same base. It was possible to obtain a performance improvement in most of the analyzed scenarios. One of the operations was used to search words in the database of the "Diário Oficial da União", and it was possible to get a speedup of 13x when compared with the online CPU solution.</p>
